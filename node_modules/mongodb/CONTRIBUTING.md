## Contributing to the driver

### Bugfixes

- Before starting to write code, look for existing [tickets](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/NODE***REMOVED*** or [create one](https://jira.mongodb.org/secure/CreateIssue!default.jspa***REMOVED*** for your specific issue under the "Node Driver" project. That way you avoid working on something that might not be of interest or that has been addressed already in a different branch.
- Fork the [repo](https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native***REMOVED*** _or_ for small documentation changes, navigate to the source on github and click the [Edit](https://github.com/blog/844-forking-with-the-edit-button***REMOVED*** button.
- Follow the general coding style of the rest of the project:
  - 2 space tabs
  - no trailing whitespace
  - comma last
  - inline documentation for new methods, class members, etc
  - 0 space between conditionals/functions, and their parenthesis and curly braces
    - `if(..***REMOVED*** {`
    - `for(..***REMOVED*** {`
    - `while(..***REMOVED*** {`
    - `function(err***REMOVED*** {`
- Write tests and make sure they pass (execute `npm test` from the cmd line to run the test suite***REMOVED***.

### Documentation

To contribute to the [API documentation](http://mongodb.github.com/node-mongodb-native/***REMOVED*** just make your changes to the inline documentation of the appropriate [source code](https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/tree/master/docs***REMOVED*** in the master branch and submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/***REMOVED***. You might also use the github [Edit](https://github.com/blog/844-forking-with-the-edit-button***REMOVED*** button.

If you'd like to preview your documentation changes, first commit your changes to your local master branch, then execute `make generate_docs`. Make sure you have the python documentation framework sphinx installed `easy_install sphinx`. The docs are generated under `docs/build'. If all looks good, submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/***REMOVED*** to the master branch with your changes.
