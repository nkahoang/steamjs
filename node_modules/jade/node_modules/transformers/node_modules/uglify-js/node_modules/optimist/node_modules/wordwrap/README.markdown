methods
=======

var wrap = require('wordwrap'***REMOVED***;

wrap(stop***REMOVED***, wrap(start, stop, params={mode:"soft"}***REMOVED***
---------------------------------------------------

Returns a function that takes a string and returns a new string.

Pad out lines with spaces out to column `start` and then wrap until column
`stop`. If a word is longer than `stop - start` characters it will overflow.

In "soft" mode, split chunks by `/(\S+\s+/` and don't break up chunks which are
longer than `stop - start`, in "hard" mode, split chunks with `/\b/` and break
up chunks longer than `stop - start`.

wrap.hard(start, stop***REMOVED***
----------------------

Like `wrap(***REMOVED***` but with `params.mode = "hard"`.
