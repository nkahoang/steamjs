# combined-stream

A stream that emits multiple other streams one after another.

## Installation

``` bash
npm install combined-stream
```

## Usage

Here is a simple example that shows how you can use combined-stream to combine
two files into one:

``` javascript
var CombinedStream = require('combined-stream'***REMOVED***;
var fs = require('fs'***REMOVED***;

var combinedStream = CombinedStream.create(***REMOVED***;
combinedStream.append(fs.createReadStream('file1.txt'***REMOVED******REMOVED***;
combinedStream.append(fs.createReadStream('file2.txt'***REMOVED******REMOVED***;

combinedStream.pipe(fs.createWriteStream('combined.txt'***REMOVED******REMOVED***;
```

While the example above works great, it will pause all source streams until
they are needed. If you don't want that to happen, you can set `pauseStreams`
to `false`:

``` javascript
var CombinedStream = require('combined-stream'***REMOVED***;
var fs = require('fs'***REMOVED***;

var combinedStream = CombinedStream.create({pauseStreams: false}***REMOVED***;
combinedStream.append(fs.createReadStream('file1.txt'***REMOVED******REMOVED***;
combinedStream.append(fs.createReadStream('file2.txt'***REMOVED******REMOVED***;

combinedStream.pipe(fs.createWriteStream('combined.txt'***REMOVED******REMOVED***;
```

However, what if you don't have all the source streams yet, or you don't want
to allocate the resources (file descriptors, memory, etc.***REMOVED*** for them right away?
Well, in that case you can simply provide a callback that supplies the stream
by calling a `next(***REMOVED***` function:

``` javascript
var CombinedStream = require('combined-stream'***REMOVED***;
var fs = require('fs'***REMOVED***;

var combinedStream = CombinedStream.create(***REMOVED***;
combinedStream.append(function(next***REMOVED*** {
  next(fs.createReadStream('file1.txt'***REMOVED******REMOVED***;
}***REMOVED***;
combinedStream.append(function(next***REMOVED*** {
  next(fs.createReadStream('file2.txt'***REMOVED******REMOVED***;
}***REMOVED***;

combinedStream.pipe(fs.createWriteStream('combined.txt'***REMOVED******REMOVED***;
```

## API

### CombinedStream.create([options]***REMOVED***

Returns a new combined stream object. Available options are:

* `maxDataSize`
* `pauseStreams`

The effect of those options is described below.

### combinedStream.pauseStreams = true

Whether to apply back pressure to the underlaying streams. If set to `false`,
the underlaying streams will never be paused. If set to `true`, the
underlaying streams will be paused right after being appended, as well as when
`delayedStream.pipe(***REMOVED***` wants to throttle.

### combinedStream.maxDataSize = 2 * 1024 * 1024

The maximum amount of bytes (or characters***REMOVED*** to buffer for all source streams.
If this value is exceeded, `combinedStream` emits an `'error'` event.

### combinedStream.dataSize = 0

The amount of bytes (or characters***REMOVED*** currently buffered by `combinedStream`.

### combinedStream.append(stream***REMOVED***

Appends the given `stream` to the combinedStream object. If `pauseStreams` is
set to `true, this stream will also be paused right away.

`streams` can also be a function that takes one parameter called `next`. `next`
is a function that must be invoked in order to provide the `next` stream, see
example above.

Regardless of how the `stream` is appended, combined-stream always attaches an
`'error'` listener to it, so you don't have to do that manually.

Special case: `stream` can also be a String or Buffer.

### combinedStream.write(data***REMOVED***

You should not call this, `combinedStream` takes care of piping the appended
streams into itself for you.

### combinedStream.resume(***REMOVED***

Causes `combinedStream` to start drain the streams it manages. The function is
idempotent, and also emits a `'resume'` event each time which usually goes to
the stream that is currently being drained.

### combinedStream.pause(***REMOVED***;

If `combinedStream.pauseStreams` is set to `false`, this does nothing.
Otherwise a `'pause'` event is emitted, this goes to the stream that is
currently being drained, so you can use it to apply back pressure.

### combinedStream.end(***REMOVED***;

Sets `combinedStream.writable` to false, emits an `'end'` event, and removes
all streams from the queue.

### combinedStream.destroy(***REMOVED***;

Same as `combinedStream.end(***REMOVED***`, except it emits a `'close'` event instead of
`'end'`.
