### Run them yourself

node-uuid comes with some benchmarks to measure performance of generating UUIDs. These can be run using node.js. node-uuid is being benchmarked against some other uuid modules, that are available through npm namely `uuid` and `uuid-js`.

To prepare and run the benchmark issue;

```
npm install uuid uuid-js
node benchmark/benchmark.js
```

You'll see an output like this one:

```
# v4
nodeuuid.v4(***REMOVED***: 854700 uuids/second
nodeuuid.v4('binary'***REMOVED***: 788643 uuids/second
nodeuuid.v4('binary', buffer***REMOVED***: 1336898 uuids/second
uuid(***REMOVED***: 479386 uuids/second
uuid('binary'***REMOVED***: 582072 uuids/second
uuidjs.create(4***REMOVED***: 312304 uuids/second

# v1
nodeuuid.v1(***REMOVED***: 938086 uuids/second
nodeuuid.v1('binary'***REMOVED***: 683060 uuids/second
nodeuuid.v1('binary', buffer***REMOVED***: 1644736 uuids/second
uuidjs.create(1***REMOVED***: 190621 uuids/second
```

* The `uuid(***REMOVED***` entries are for Nikhil Marathe's [uuid module](https://bitbucket.org/nikhilm/uuidjs***REMOVED*** which is a wrapper around the native libuuid library.
* The `uuidjs(***REMOVED***` entries are for Patrick Negri's [uuid-js module](https://github.com/pnegri/uuid-js***REMOVED*** which is a pure javascript implementation based on [UUID.js](https://github.com/LiosK/UUID.js***REMOVED*** by LiosK.

If you want to get more reliable results you can run the benchmark multiple times and write the output into a log file:

```
for i in {0..9}; do node benchmark/benchmark.js >> benchmark/bench_0.4.12.log; done;
```

If you're interested in how performance varies between different node versions, you can issue the above command multiple times.

You can then use the shell script `bench.sh` provided in this directory to calculate the averages over all benchmark runs and draw a nice plot:

```
(cd benchmark/ && ./bench.sh***REMOVED***
```

This assumes you have [gnuplot](http://www.gnuplot.info/***REMOVED*** and [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/***REMOVED*** installed. You'll find a nice `bench.png` graph in the `benchmark/` directory then.
