# Compressible [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/expressjs/compressible.png***REMOVED***](https://travis-ci.org/expressjs/compressible***REMOVED***

Compressible `Content-Type` / `mime` checking.

## API

### compressible(type***REMOVED***

```js
var compressible = require('compressible'***REMOVED***
compressible('text/html'***REMOVED*** // -> true
compressible('image/png'***REMOVED*** // -> false
```

### compressible.get(type***REMOVED***

Returns the specifications object associated with the given `Content-Type`.
Generates an object using the regex if none is found.

### compressible.specs

Exports `specifications.json`.

### compressible.regex

The regular expression that checks the `Content-Type`.
However, you should use `compressible(type***REMOVED***` instead of this regular expression due to additional non-regex checks.
