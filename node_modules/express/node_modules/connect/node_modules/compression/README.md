Connect's compress middleware as its own module. Works with and without Connect.

```js
var compress = require('compression'***REMOVED***(***REMOVED***

http.createServer(function (req, res***REMOVED*** {
  compress(req, res, function (err***REMOVED*** {
    if (err***REMOVED*** throw err

    res.end('hello world'***REMOVED***
***REMOVED******REMOVED***
}***REMOVED***

var app = require('connect'***REMOVED***(***REMOVED***
app.use(compress***REMOVED***
```

## API

### var middleware = compress([options]***REMOVED***

In addition to `zlib` options, additional options are:

- `threshold` <1kb> - only compress the response if the byte size is at or above a threshold
- `filter` - a filter callback function
