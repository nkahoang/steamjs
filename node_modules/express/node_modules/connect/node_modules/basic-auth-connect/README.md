# simgr - Simple Image Resizer [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/expressjs/basic-auth-connect.png***REMOVED***](https://travis-ci.org/expressjs/basic-auth-connect***REMOVED***

Connect's Basic Auth middleware in its own module. This module is considered deprecated. You should instead create your own middleware with [basic-auth](https://github.com/visionmedia/node-basic-auth***REMOVED***.

## API

```js
var basicAuth = require('basic-auth-connect'***REMOVED***;
```

Sorry, couldn't think of a more clever name.

Simple username and password

```js
connect(***REMOVED***
.use(basicAuth('username', 'password'***REMOVED******REMOVED***;
```

Callback verification

```js
connect(***REMOVED***
.use(basicAuth(function(user, pass***REMOVED***{
  return 'tj' == user && 'wahoo' == pass;
}***REMOVED******REMOVED***
```

Async callback verification, accepting `fn(err, user***REMOVED***`.

```
connect(***REMOVED***
.use(basicAuth(function(user, pass, fn***REMOVED***{
  User.authenticate({ user: user, pass: pass }, fn***REMOVED***;
}***REMOVED******REMOVED***
```
