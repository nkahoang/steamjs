# Raw Body [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/stream-utils/raw-body.png***REMOVED***](https://travis-ci.org/stream-utils/raw-body***REMOVED***

Gets the entire buffer of a stream either as a `Buffer` or a string.
Validates the stream's length against an expected length and maximum limit.
Ideal for parsing request bodies.

## API

```js
var getRawBody = require('raw-body'***REMOVED***

app.use(function (req, res, next***REMOVED*** {
  getRawBody(req, {
    length: req.headers['content-length'],
    limit: '1mb',
    encoding: 'utf8'
***REMOVED***, function (err, string***REMOVED*** {
    if (err***REMOVED***
      return next(err***REMOVED***

    req.text = string
    next(***REMOVED***
***REMOVED******REMOVED***
}***REMOVED***
```

or in a Koa generator:

```js
app.use(function* (next***REMOVED*** {
  var string = yield getRawBody(this.req, {
    length: this.length,
    limit: '1mb',
    encoding: 'utf8'
***REMOVED******REMOVED***
}***REMOVED***
```

### getRawBody(stream, [options], [callback]***REMOVED***

Returns a thunk for yielding with generators.

Options:

- `length` - The length length of the stream.
  If the contents of the stream do not add up to this length,
  an `400` error code is returned.
- `limit` - The byte limit of the body.
  If the body ends up being larger than this limit,
  a `413` error code is returned.
- `encoding` - The requested encoding.
  By default, a `Buffer` instance will be returned.
  Most likely, you want `utf8`.
  You can use any type of encoding supported by [StringDecoder](http://nodejs.org/api/string_decoder.html***REMOVED***.
  You can also pass `true` which sets it to the default `utf8`

`callback(err, res***REMOVED***`:

- `err` - the following attributes will be defined if applicable:

    - `limit` - the limit in bytes
    - `length` and `expected` - the expected length of the stream
    - `received` - the received bytes
    - `status` and `statusCode` - the corresponding status code for the error
    - `type` - either `entity.too.large`, `request.size.invalid`, or `stream.encoding.set`

- `res` - the result, either as a `String` if an encoding was set or a `Buffer` otherwise.

If an error occurs, the stream will be paused,
and you are responsible for correctly disposing the stream.
For HTTP requests, no handling is required if you send a response.
For streams that use file descriptors, you should `stream.destroy(***REMOVED***` or `stream.close(***REMOVED***` to prevent leaks.
