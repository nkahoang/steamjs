```

## Installation

    $ npm install -g express

## Quick Start

 Create the app:

    $ npm install -g express
    $ express /tmp/foo && cd /tmp/foo

 Install dependencies:

    $ npm install

 Start the server:

    $ node app

## Features

  * Built on [Connect](http://github.com/senchalabs/connect***REMOVED***
  * Robust routing
  * HTTP helpers (redirection, caching, etc***REMOVED***
  * View system supporting 14+ template engines
  * Content negotiation
  * Focus on high performance
  * Environment based configuration
  * Executable for generating applications quickly
  * High test coverage

## Philosophy

  The Express philosophy is to provide small, robust tooling for HTTP servers, making
  it a great solution for single page applications, web sites, hybrids, or public
  HTTP APIs.

  Built on Connect, you can use _only_ what you need, and nothing more. Applications
  can be as big or as small as you like, even a single file. Express does
  not force you to use any specific ORM or template engine. With support for over
  14 template engines via [Consolidate.js](http://github.com/visionmedia/consolidate.js***REMOVED***,
  you can quickly craft your perfect framework.
